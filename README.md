# Task Manager Fullstack App

This Task Manager application is a full-stack project built using Laravel (backend API) and React (frontend), with authentication via Firebase. It is designed to manage tasks and projects efficiently.

## ‚ú® Main Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and login using Firebase Authentication.
- **Task Management (CRUD)**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
- **Project Management (CRUD)**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete projects.
- **Task & Project Relationship**: Tasks can be linked to specific projects, with a ‚ÄúNot in any project‚Äù option.
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Task and project operations feel instant with animated feedback, even before server confirmation.
- **Advanced Caching with React Query**: Tasks and projects are cached intelligently to prevent unnecessary refetching.
- **Pagination**: Tasks inside dashboards use client-side pagination for better UX and performance.
- **Global Search**: The top search bar filters tasks and projects across different pages.
- **Detailed Modal Views**: Task detail can be viewed in an interactive modal with full styling.
- **Dynamic Task Count Sync**: Task counts and completed counts update automatically between Dashboard and Project view.

## üîê Firebase Project Setup

This app uses **Firebase Authentication** for user management.

### 1. Create New Firebase Project

- Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Click "Add project" and follow the steps. Name your project (e.g., `task-manager-app-yourname`).
- You may disable Google Analytics for simplicity.

### 2. Enable Email/Password Authentication

- In your Firebase Console, navigate to **Build > Authentication**.
- Go to the **Sign-in method** tab.
- Enable **Email/Password** sign-in method.
- **Important**: Click **Save**.

### 3. Get Firebase Credentials (Client-side)

- Go to **Project Settings** (gear icon).
- Scroll down to **Your apps**.
- Click the **Web (</>)** icon to register a web app.
- You'll get a `firebaseConfig` object.
- Copy the values: `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, `storageBucket`, `messagingSenderId`, `appId`.

### 4. Get Firebase Credentials (Server-side - Service Account)

- Go to **Project Settings > Service accounts**.
- Click **Generate new private key**, confirm and download the `.json` file (e.g., `yourproject-firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx.json`).
- Keep this file **secure**.

## üì¶ Installation and Setup

This is a **monorepo**: Laravel (backend) and React (frontend) are in the same Git repo.

### üß¨ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabrielNathanael/Task-Manager-Fullstack-App.git
cd Task-Manager-Fullstack-App
```

---

## üîß Backend Setup (Laravel)

### 1. Enter Backend Directory

```bash
cd task-manager-backend
```

### 2. Install Composer Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Setup `.env` File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` in your code editor.

### 4. Generate Laravel App Key

If `APP_KEY` is empty, run:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Configure MySQL Database

Adjust these values in `.env`:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=task_manager_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Create the database manually in MySQL first (e.g., via phpMyAdmin or MySQL CLI).

### 6. Setup Firebase Credentials (Server-side)

- Move the downloaded Firebase service account JSON file to:

```
task-manager-backend/storage/app/firebase/
```

- Update these lines in `.env`:

```env
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=firebase/your-firebase-adminsdk.json
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
```

### 7. Run Database Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

> This will wipe existing tables and re-seed fresh data.

‚úÖ Backend is now ready.

## üñº Frontend Setup (React)

### 1. Return to Project Root

```bash
cd ..
```

### 2. Enter Frontend Directory

```bash
cd task-manager-frontend
```

### 3. Install npm Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Install Additional UI Libraries

The app uses:

- `lucide-react` for icons.
- `@tanstack/react-table` for table views.
- `@tanstack/react-query` for caching and async state.
- `framer-motion` and `react-intersection-observer` for animations.

To ensure smooth UI, install them if not already present:

```bash
npm install lucide-react @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-table framer-motion react-intersection-observer
```

### 5. Tailwind CSS v4 Setup

Follow the official Tailwind CSS v4 + Vite installation guide:

üëâ [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite)

---

### 6. Setup `.env.local`

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` in your code editor with your Firebase config:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTHDOMAIN="YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECTID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGEBUCKET="YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGINGSENDERID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
VITE_FIREBASE_APPID="YOUR_APP_ID"
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:8000/api"
